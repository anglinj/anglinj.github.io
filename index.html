              <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What type of game is it?</a>
              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                Will you find yourself battling to the death with thousands of enemies surrounding you or will you voyage through the ocean with a crew of pirates? Will you soar through the sky like a mythical hero or will you traverse through space? Where will your stories take you?<br>
                This is a storytelling game that gives players the opportunity to create compelling stories together that will be remembered for years to come. Each card will help dictate how the story will unfold, but it's up to the group’s collective imagination to weave together a truly remarkable tale.

              <a href="#" class="accordion-title">It is like D&amp;D?</a>
              <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
                Not really as D&amp;D is a table top RPG. This games focuses on the story elements more so than the players taking control of just one character and/or aspect of the story. That being said we are Alpha testing a table top RPG version of the game.

                We just completed the Beta testing phase of the game and we will be doing other play throughs at local games shops soon, we will post them in the events soon. Sorry for the slight delay.

          <p>
            For Nick and Jon a night of casual gaming turned into an idea which has since become a grand dream. The dream to see people connect personally and have memorable experiences through the power of tabletop gaming. At MRG, we currently have 4 games we are working on.  We have held numerous playtests and have even entered into the design phase with a few and people are definitely showing interest. Mad Rabbit Games is the ultimate culmination of years of collaboration, but we need your help to incorporate. Between lawyers fees, copyrights, trademarks, contract drafting, production cost, and the like we’ve realized we need financial help to get this dream off the ground.

          <h4>Introduction to our alpha game</h4>
          <p>
            You and your group find yourselves stranded on the side of the road after a long day of driving. Tossing your head back in defeat, you stare out the windshield at the sunset as it slides beneath the horizon, the heavens melting from blue to yellow to a deep red, before finally fading to black.
          </p>
   
          <p>
            The only light you and your friends have now is a street lamp directly above your broken down vehicle. You pull the lever popping your car’s hood and get out​ to check the engine.
          </p>
   
          <p>
            Suddenly, a horribly loud scraping emanates from behind you. You turn around quickly to discover the outline of a figure at least 9 feet tall, barely visible at the outskirts of the streetlight. You see it immediately, the flash of a large metal object that has been hurled in your direction. Without thinking, you lunge out of the way just in time to watch the massive object bury itself deep into the hood of the vehicle, nearly thrusting the entire engine underneath it.
          </p>
   
          <p>
            Your friends tumble out of the car and begin running for the tree line on the other side of the road. You hurry after them. The further into the woods you go the thicker trees become...and did you see a face in the one you just passed? Looking back, you realize whatever you are running from isn’t following you.
          </p>
   
          <p>
            Just as you begin to turn your head back around, you slam into one of your friends causing you both to fall to the ground. Dusting yourself off while helping your friend to their feet apologetically, you look up to find yourself staring at an enormous rot iron gate that is slowly opening. Written in mangled, almost illegible letters above the gate you read: Welcome to COG
          </p>

          <p>
            You and your friends are stranded on the side of the road one minute and the next you are taking shelter inside twisted iron gates leading into a desolate landscape of faded tents and broken rides. This is a co-op survival game that takes you through outlandish obstacles, bizarre events, and terrifying monsters that seem have jumped straight from your nightmares.
