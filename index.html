        <h4>About Our Story Telling Game</h4>

        <ul class="accordion" data-accordion>
          <li class="accordion-item is-active" data-accordion-item>
            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">What type of game is it?</a>
            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              Will you find yourself battling to the death with thousands of enemies surrounding you or will you voyage through the ocean with a crew of pirates? Will you soar through the sky like a mythical hero or will you traverse through space? Where will your stories take you?<br>
              This is a storytelling game that gives players the opportunity to create compelling stories together that will be remembered for years to come. Each card will help dictate how the story will unfold, but it's up to the group’s collective imagination to weave together a truly remarkable tale.

          <li class="accordion-item" data-accordion-item>
            <a href="#" class="accordion-title">It is like D&amp;D?</a>
            <div class="accordion-content" data-tab-content>
              Not really as D&amp;D is a table top RPG. This games focuses on the story elements more so than the players taking control of just one character and/or aspect of the story. That being said we are Alpha testing a table top RPG version of the game.

              We just completed the Beta testing phase of the game and we will be doing other play throughs at local games shops soon, we will post them in the events soon. Sorry for the slight delay.

        <p>
          For Nick and Jon a night of casual gaming turned into an idea which has since become a grand dream. The dream to see people connect personally and have memorable experiences through the power of tabletop gaming. At MRG, we currently have 4 games we are working on.  We have held numerous playtests and have even entered into the design phase with a few and people are definitely showing interest. Mad Rabbit Games is the ultimate culmination of years of collaboration, but we need your help to incorporate. Between lawyers fees, copyrights, trademarks, contract drafting, production cost, and the like we’ve realized we need financial help to get this dream off the ground.
